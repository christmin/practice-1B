        I send my Mercedes Benz to Auto Clean monthly for a thorough cleansing
        service. I must say that I am impressed with the quality as they not
        only wash the exterior but also clean the interior of the car. Thumbs
        up. --- Bernard

        I provide limousine service and I always send my car to Auto Clean as
        they are highly professional and efficient. I can get my limo totally
        washed and vacuumed in 15 minutes before I head off to pick up a new
        client. I never has a complaint about the cleaniness of my limo. ---
